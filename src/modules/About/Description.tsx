        I'm 27 years old, a Fullstack Developer student with a strong interest in fashion and online
        shopping. I understand how any eCommerce store works, how their return policies work, I
        research for discounts, special pieces that are difficult to find, and I have endless
        patience to scroll until I find what I want, and it is just EASY for me.
        <Text>
          When it comes to online shopping, I've always been the person who helps everyone around
          me.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          So I thought, why not be that person for other people who require this type of service?
          Making people look and feel good about themselves make me feel satisfied, and I believe it
          is a need that is stillÂ underserved on the needs list.
